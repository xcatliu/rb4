## Components

I don't think all components should be implemented by React.

For example, implement a `Button` component seems meaningless, as we can easily using Bootstrap classes to styling our button.

Here is a list of which components should be implemented by React Bootstrap 4:

Component | Should be Implemented | Reasons
--------- | --------------------- | -------
Button    | :x:                   |
Modal     | :white_check_mark:    |
