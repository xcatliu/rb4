## Components

Not all Bootstrap components should be built by React.

For example, implement a `Button` component seems meaningless, as we can easily using Bootstrap classes to styling our buttons.

Here is a list of components we offered:

Component | Implemented or not | Remarks
--------- | ------------------ | -------
Button    | :x:                |
Modal     | :white_check_mark: |
